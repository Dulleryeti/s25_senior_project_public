# s25_senior_project
This repository will contain the code for the UT Discovery & Design Day mobile application for my senior capstone at Utah Tech University.

This mobile application will be developed for Utah Tech University, specifically for Discovery & Design Day. 

The purpose of this app is to overall enhance the Design Day experience for the community. 

## Figma Wireframes and Designs

Here are the designs that I came up with before implementing the mobile application. Heavily inspired by the Eventbrite Mobile Application
